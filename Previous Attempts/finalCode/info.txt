hi hi!!!
so uploading two versions:
- the final project mcmc working (OG) is the one with the chain i'm running - the chi-square value has stablised out from what i've managed to see so far, but it was oscillating wildly at the beignning, now, it's around 14,000.
- the final project mcmc working copy 1 (Copy 1) i made some modifications to while I was running the other one... I wanted to put the errors back in and see how that would affect the chi-Squared. But the other one is still running and I'm giving up waiting for it to be done, so i'll just let it run overnight instead of trying copy 1.
this means that Copy 1 hasn't been debugged yet :(((( but if someone wants to run it and see what chi-Squared looks like for comparison that would be cool!
but i think also running OG would be good just for more chain values, yk? currently i think mine is suppose to go till a length of 50,000 but it's been at least six and it's only around 15,000. so i'm not sure how possible it is to run. 

UPDATE!!
the final version of the code is finalVersion.ipynb. PLEASE RUN THIS VERSION. It is the de-bugged and slightly modified version of  the final project mcmc working copy 1. WHEN RUNNING THIS VERSION PLEASE CHANGE THE NREPEATS VALUE TO 100 OR ABOVE.
