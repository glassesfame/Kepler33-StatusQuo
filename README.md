# MCMCforTTVs
using Rebound to calculate the Keplerian orbits of Kepler 33, and then using MCMC to fit these orbits to TTV measurements.

To make the simplification, we see that (from the textbook pdf):
The three angles (i , Ω, ω) represent the projection of the true orbit into the observed (apparent) orbit;
they depend solely on the orientation of the observer with respect to the orbit.
