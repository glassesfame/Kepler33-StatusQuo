,b,c,d,e,f,Notes: time is given in days
a,0.0673,0.1181,0.165,0.212,0.252,the semi-major axis in AU
e,0.2,0.05,0.03,0.02,0.02,the eccentricity of the orbit given by the upper bound
inc,90,90,90,90,90,we assume the inc = 90 for planar orbits
omega,tbd,tbd,tbd,tbd,,the longitude of ascending node
Omega,0,0,0,0,0,the periapisis in radians which give us when the planet is closest to the star
f,tbd,tbd,tbd,tbd,,the true anomaly which will give us our initial position
m,,19,8.2,6.6,8.2,"mass is given by earth masses, we have the upper bound for c and d"
